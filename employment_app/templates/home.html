	science/MIS are ready immediately.</li>

      <li>   Unemployed novice programmers offer programming services to startups with simple app or web-design requirements.</li>

      <li>    Startups offer equity or delayed transaction-based payments to learning programmers.</li>
      <li>    For startups, the purpose is to give them an affordable 
	prototype that allows investors to evaluate and fund the production 
	version of their idea. For job trainees, it gives them real-world 
	learning experience and qualifies them to apply for entry-level 
	programming positions,or to start their own startup. </li><p></p>
